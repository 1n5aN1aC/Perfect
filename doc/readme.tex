\section{Overall System Design}

There are 8 Used packet types in the system:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | p{5cm} |}
    \hline
    Packet ID & <-> & Name & Description \\ \hline
    0 & c <-> s & Keep-Alive & Apacket That is Completly Unused but   
    The server will ping it back to the client if received. \\ \hline
    1 & c -> s & Range Request & The Client sends this to the server
    To ask for work to do.  Payload is the range
    of numbers the client would like \\ \hline
    2 & c <- s & Assign Range & Server sends this back to the client
    Payload is the number the client should start at
    It is implied that the Client should do how much they requested past that \\ \hline
	3 & c -> s & Found Number & Client Sends this to server When Number Found \\ \hline
	4 & c -> s & Unused & Unused \\ \hline
	5 & c <-> s & Report Found & Reporter Uses to ask Server What numbers were found \\ \hline
	6 & c <-> s & Report Clients & Reporter Uses to ask Server What Clients are connected \\ \hline
	7 & <-> & Report Number & Reporter Uses to ask Server What Number we are currently on \\ \hline
	8 & - & Unused & Unused \\ \hline
	9 & c <-> s & Kill & A server can send this to the clients to tell them to shut down
    or a reporter can send this to the Server to tell it to stop
	Its clients and shut down.\\ \hline
